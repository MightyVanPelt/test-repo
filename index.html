        <em>What I Did This Summer</em>
    </h2>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif">
     I spent most of this summer working and moving into my room in Culver. I also got the wonderful privilege of being able to move my parents back to Tennessee (it wasn't really a privilege). Unfortunately towards the end of the summer I was unfortunate enough to catch covid and had to quarantine for most of the registration process.

        <em>What Are My Strengths?</em>
    </h2>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif">
     I like to think that I am a quick thinker and a great problem solver, which is what made me interested in being a computer science major. I also happen to be a quick learner and can pick up many concepts without much explanation.

       <em>What Am I Excited About?</em> 
    </h2>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif"> I am excited to be learning to utilize tools like html and css to be able to create functional web pages that are also pleasing to the eye. I think that when utilized correctly, there is no limit to what can be done with tools like html.

        <em>What Am I Concerned/Wondering About?</em>
    </h2>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif">
    There is not too much that I am really concerned about, as I feel quite comfortable learning to use these tools like html and css. Maybe later down the line I might have more questions and concerns. There is also not a lot that I am wondering about as far as this course goes, however I am sure I will have more questions later on down the line.

    <em>Above and Beyond</em>
</h2>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif">
    To go above and beyond I changed the font of all of the paragraphs to sans serif and I changed the color of the main header to red. I also changed the font of all of the headers to verdana. Finally, I also made all of the headings italicized.
